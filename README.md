# Mega Calculator

## Overview
Mega Calculator is a C++ program that includes advanced features like maze generation and pathfinding. It generates a random maze, uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path from the start to the end, and displays the maze with the solution. The program handles edge cases and ensures efficient traversal of the maze.

## Features
- Random maze generation with walls and open spaces.
- Depth-First Search (DFS) for pathfinding.
- Path visualized as a sequence of steps.
- Error handling for invalid maze configurations.
- Simple user input for maze dimensions.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio).
3. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file using your preferred IDE or terminal.

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o MegaCalculator
./MegaCalculator
```

## Usage
1. The program will generate a random maze.
2. It will then attempt to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner using Depth-First Search.
3. The maze and the solution path will be displayed.
